## Code of Conduct

First and foremost, this project shares many of the values of the [Rust
community](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html) as a whole, which
include:

> * We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
> * Please be kind and courteous. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.
> * Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
> * Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

With this in mind, please read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
included with this project -- it serves as the official guideline of expected
behavior in general when collaborating on this project.
